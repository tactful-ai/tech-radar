# Tactful Technology Radar

Inspired by [ThoughtWorks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). And uses the [Build Your Own Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor) tool

Since **T**actful is also a **T** shaped company, we move fast and try to adopt to technological advancements and maintain a lean, strong, small team. That is why we love to explore new technologies and techniques than can help us stay lean and keep building software fun.
